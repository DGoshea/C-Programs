Dijkstra's Notes:

Dijkstra's algorithm initializes all vertices' distances to infinity (âˆž), initializes all vertices' predecessors to null, and enqueues all vertices into a queue of unvisited vertices. The algorithm then assigns the start vertex's distance with 0. While the queue is not empty, the algorithm dequeues the vertex with the shortest distance. For each adjacent vertex, the algorithm computes the distance of the path from the start vertex to the current vertex and continuing on to the adjacent vertex. If that path's distance is shorter than the adjacent vertex's current distance, a shorter path has been found. The adjacent vertex's current distance is updated to the distance of the newly found shorter path's distance, and vertex's predecessor pointer is pointed to the current vertex.
